# Student-Speciality-Group-Counter
This Python script facilitates the analysis of student data to compare the distribution of top-performing students between two college groups. Reads data copied from exam results that contain student ID numbers, their first names and surnames from a text file. Then it converts them to a CSV format and removes the unnecessary information. After that, it reads student IDs associated with specialty choice rounds (the earliest choice round, the better student is). Then it uses this info to group and count students from groups to compare which one has better students.

It also has a function to retrieve the selection round that a student with a specified ID was in.
